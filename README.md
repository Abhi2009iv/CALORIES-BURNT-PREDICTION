<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project predicts the **number of calories burnt** during physical exercise using **machine learning**.  
It combines user demographic data and physical attributes with exercise-related information to train a predictive model.

The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates calorie expenditure useful for **fitness apps, wearables, and health analytics platforms**.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="problem-statement"></a>problem-statement</h2>

With increasing awareness around fitness tracking, accurate estimation of calories burnt has become an essential feature for health applications.
However, calorie burn depends on multiple factors like body composition, workout intensity, and duration making it non-linear and difficult to estimate manually.
This project addresses the problem by:
- Analyzing user and exercise data to find hidden patterns.
- Using an XGBoost Regression Model to predict calories burnt with high accuracy.
- Evaluating performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure reliability.
